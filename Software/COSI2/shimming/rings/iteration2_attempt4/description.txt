simulated one insert
shim radius reduced to 260 mm
strength of magnets incerased by a factor of 1.35*2 = 2.7
run shim script on one insert, all rotations in the insert against z
shim gives rotations along z which is correct.
ran same script for full map, fresh, no inserts. (only the 4 rings of iter1 are in)
4 rings generated.
